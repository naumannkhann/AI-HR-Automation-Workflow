# AI-HR-Automation-Workflow #

An AI-driven HR automation workflow using Make.com that automatically screens resumes and shortlists candidates — without human intervention in the initial screening stage.

What this automation does:
*Triggers automatically when a candidate submits an application form.
*Downloads the resume from Google Drive.
*Extracts resume content from the PDF.
*Uses Google Gemini (AI) to analyze skills and relevance.
*Decides whether a candidate is shortlisted or rejected.

Sends automated emails to:
*The HR team with screening results.
*The candidate with selection or rejection status.

Why this matters:
*Saves hours of manual resume screening.
*Ensures consistent and unbiased initial evaluation.
*Improves response time and candidate experience.
*Scales easily as applications increase.

This is a great example of how AI + workflow automation can simplify real-world business processes, especially in HR and recruitment.
